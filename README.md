## Hi, there

###Welcome to my GitHub!!

I'm a senior full stack & reactjs developer with heavy experience in Laravel, Django, Node, React/Redux/Saga, single Page Application & Progressive Web Apps.
Also, I have rich experience in Babel, Webpack in combination with React.
 
I use React & Redux for front-end and Node or Laravel for building the REST APIs and it goes without saying that I'm the master of HTML, CSS, SASS & mobile responsive design.
 
Also, I am highly experienced in Amazon web services and modern javascript trends like functional programming, serverside rendering, Lodash and so on.
 
So, I always build clean, manageable, reusable and scalable code.
I also have an availability of full-time working as well as a honest & diligent attitude.
I used to many remote working tools like slack, zoom & discord.
I've usually been responsible for achieving very challenging objectives for past projects.

Thank you for viewing my profile.
Take Care!
